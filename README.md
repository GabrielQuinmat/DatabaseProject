# DatabaseProject
This will connect to a DB making a connection with JDBC and using Jasper Report Library for reports (still not implemented)

For its use, first you have to connect to a DB using a URL, in Database Menu. Then if the URL, user and password is accepted, you can make queries for retrieving data in the scripts tab or even for modifications. The result of the queries will be in the table tab.
